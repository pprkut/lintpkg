To run all the testcases,
  # sh ./RunTestCases.sh

This will make a lot of small packages in $OUTPUT (default /tmp) and then run
lintpkg on each of the small packages.  The results for each package are
compared with the contents of usr/doc/<package>-0.0/expected which is stored
inside the package.  If the results are different from the contents of the
'expected' file, this is considered to be a failure.

If a testcase fails, it will look like this:
  FAIL lintpkg-testcase-man-bad-0.0-x86_64-1_lintpkg.txz

To find out why it failed, run the check manually, e.g.
  # lintpkg -c man_check.sh /tmp/lintpkg-testcase-man-bad-0.0-x86_64-1_lintpkg.txz

and compare the output with the contents of the file
  man-bad/usr/doc/lintpkg-testcase-man-bad-0.0/expected
